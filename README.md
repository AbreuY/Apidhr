**Registering for an API Key**

As before, an API key is required for requests to be processed by the system. 
Once a user registers, an API key is automatically generated for this user. The API key must attached to request via the api parameter. Register for free on [DHR URL SHORTENER](http://dhr.me)


**Using the API in PHP**

To use the API in your PHP application, you have to send a GET request through **file_get_contents** or cURL: Both are reliable methods. 

See the **example-api.php** file using **file_get_contents**.
